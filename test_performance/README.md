To run the tests run the bash script test.sh
It will perform 10 tests for each operation for each type on each input file for sequential, 4 threads and 8 threads
The python script is limited to only check the 10 tests, if you want to do a higher frequency of tests it needs to be modified
If you want to test it yourself you need to delete the results stored in each op folder inside of sequential, thread4 and thread8
